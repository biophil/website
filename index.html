          <h1>About Me</h1>
          I am an Assistant Professor in the department of <a href="https://www.uccs.edu/cs/">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.uccs.edu">University of Colorado, Colorado Springs</a>. I received my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2018 under the supervision of <a href="http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/%7Ejrmarden/index.html">
            Jason R. Marden</a> in the <a href="http://www.ccdc.ucsb.edu">Center for Control, Dynamical-Systems, and Computation (CCDC)</a> at the <a href="http://www.ucsb.edu">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>.<br>
          <br>
          I'm a native of Southern Colorado, and enjoy anything that gets me          outdoors on a regular basis: hiking, mountain biking, camping, trail
          running, and <a href="http://www.14ers.com/peakbag.php">14er bagging</a>.<br><br><br>
<h1>Research Interests</h1>I am interested in developing fundamental theory to describe the 
interaction between technology and society. To study this, I use tools 
from game theory, optimization, control theory, and various          
multi-agent systems concepts. <br><br><strong>Influencing Behavior in Cyber-Social Systems: </strong>I am generally interested in the effect of financial incentives on
          crowd behavior, particularly with an eye to complex, interconnected
          systems. I like to tell people that I study "Pricing as an engineering
          problem," where we measure the effectiveness of prices by the social
          outcomes they incentivize rather than the revenue they garner.
          <br><br><strong>Strategic Aspects of Security:</strong> One high-level way to understand cyber-security problems is to envision them as a "game" between a defender and an attacker. In this paradigm, the defender attempts to design a security system as a function of some model of the attacker's strategy. Here, I seek to understand how security vulnerabilities may arise as a result of mis-modeled attackers.
          <br><br><strong>Robust Network Games:</strong> Recent years have witnessed great strides in the use of game theory as an overarching framework to inform the design of networked control systems. However, significant questions remain as to the robustness of game-theory-derived control designs. I am interested in identifying and circumventing these known robustness bottlenecks.
          <!-- <br><br><strong>Applications and Design of Blockchains:</strong> In the past ten years, Bitcoin has risen to infamy in its attempt to undercut traditional financial intermediaries. <br> --><br>
